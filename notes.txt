LEARNINGS:

05-24-2023 10:43pm.

    Make sure that the python version you are using has the pip install venv  

    Command for creating a virtual environment in python
        python3 -m venv .venv or python -m venv .venv
        source .venv/bin/activate or .venv/Scripts/activate
        deactivate

    Intalling Django
        python -m pip install Django

    Creating a Django App
        django-admin startproject <app_name>

    Access Command (Learned)
        django-admin
        - is used to get all commands available in django
        - on the settings.py inside joemar25 folder. it is the heart

    Running the Server
        python manage.py runserver
    
    Create App
        python manage.py startapp <app-name>
         - by default this will put the application to the BASE
         - can be tricky at first on navigating on creating the application on a folder

            on application -> python ../manage.py startapp blogs
            on application/apps -> python ../../manage.py startapp blogs
            on application/apps -> python ../../manage.py startapp portfolio

         - creating a app means this will not mean you can use it yet
         - you need to register that to the joemar25/settings.py -> INSTALLED_APPS
         - this will open up the views which the clients will see
    
    Database Migration
        python manage.py migrate
        - this will allow to migrate the database
        - in this stage you must update the model.py that suits your needs

        python -m pip install Pillow
        - if you were using image or videos

        python manage.py makemigrations
        - this is the setting up stage before the real migration to the db
        python manage.py migrate

        python manage.py createsuperuser
        - by now you can create your own user account for admin in django
        - login in /admin -> joemar, joemar000, 06jo!
        - use CRUD operation

        ------------------------------
        tricky to have db on _root
            python manage.py makemigrations blogs
            python manage.py migrate blog

    Using flowbite
        python -m pip install django-compressor
        - configure settings.py and add compressor
